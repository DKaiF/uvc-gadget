# uvc-gadget

A fork of the Ideas On Board uvc-gadget "test" application to match the reccomended patch from the Linux kernel for testing, etc.

This is being done to get a complete check-in of the four patches lurking about, NOT merged into the current tree from the original upstream, so that there's an easy one-stop shop for the test/server application that the Linux kernel documentation talks about that might just get some maintenance for at least a little bit.

It is hoped that eventually, with this being proven out, that it makes it back to the original upstream, or that this becomes it since the current circumstance isn't really a good thing.
